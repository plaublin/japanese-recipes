title:  "Dorayaki"
image: dorayaki.jpg
tags: cake, pancake, anko

ingredients:
- 160g flour
- azuki beans (yude azuki) 160g
- 4 eggs
- 70g sugar
- 2 small spoons of honey
- 1 small spoon of baking powder


directions:
- in a big bowl, mix the 4 eggs
- add sugar and mix
- add the honey and mix
- add flour and mix (to avoid clumps you can use a sifter)
- add the baking powder and mix
- leave in the fridge for 30 minutes
- make pancakes. How-to is similar to crepes: heat a pan on medium fire, add a bit of oil, add a bit of the preparation with a ladle and make a round shape. It should be rather small compared to a crepe, unless you want to make giant dorayakis. Once some the bubbles start to break, turn it over and cook for 1 or 2 minutes
- put some anko in between 2 pancakes and push a bit on the edges so that the two pancakes slightly merge
- serve

For around 8 dorayakis.
Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqzegNXTVYs">this recipe</a>.
Compared to the raw azuki beans, the yude azuki are already prepared, so you don't need to spend an entire night washing and preparing them.
