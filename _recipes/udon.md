ingredients:
- frozen udon
- 1 leak
- 2 eggs
- 150g chicken tender ("sasami")
- tsuyu (Japanese sauce)
- cooking sake

directions:
- cut the leak in diagonal, don't use the leaves
- cut the sasami in small pieces (~1cm)
- put a bit of cooking sake and tsuyu on the sasami
- boil the eggs (10 minutes)
- boil water for the udon; not a lot, just enough so the udon will be under water
- put the udon, still frozen, inside the water
- once cooked (generally takes 3~5 minutes), add tsuyu and stop the fire
- in a fry pan, fry the leak and sasami with tsuyu
- once fried, put them inside the udon pan and mix
- divide the udon, leak and sasami, as well as the juice, inside the serving bowls
- cut the eggs in two and add them on top of the bowls
